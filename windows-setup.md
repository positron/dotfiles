## Misc

Should be keyed to the motherboard serial number if you are just reinstalling.

For new builds, these days the only limitation if you don't buy windows is you can't change the desktop background (though it syncs your current one from your account?) and the desktop has a watermark that appears after a while.

## Settings
It appears 95% of the settings I prefer (like "always show file extensions") are synced to your account now!
