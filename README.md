# Philip's Dot Files
These are the config files to set up a system to maximize my productivity.  df

## Installation
`git clone git@github.com:positron/dotfiles.git`
`git submodule init`
`git submodule update`

run `./setup` in Unix/Cygwin shells and `setup.bat` in Windows.

## Features
Lots of stuff I have accumulated over the years.

Most config files source a .local file if it exists so you can have configuration specific to one system.
