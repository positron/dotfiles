# Philip's Dot Files
These are the config files to set up a system to maximize my productivity.

## Installation
run `./setup` in Unix/Cygwin shells and `setup.bat` in Windows.

## Vundle
Plugins are managed by the Vundle plugin.

To update plugins:

    :BundleInstall!

To remove plugins after deleting them from the `.vimrc`:

    :BundleClean!

## Features
Lots of stuff I have accumulated over the years.

Most config files source a .local file if it exists so you can have configuration specific to one system.
