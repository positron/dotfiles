# Philip's Dot Files
These are the config files to set up a system to maximize my productivity.

## Installation
Run ./config-macos.sh to configure OS X.

Run `./setup` in OS X/*nix/WSL shells to install utilities and link all dotfiles.

## Features
Lots of stuff I have accumulated over the years. :-)

Most config files source a .local version of that file if it exists (e.g. for secrets or work specific aliases).

## WSL
The best setup I've found is to install ConEmu and use that.
